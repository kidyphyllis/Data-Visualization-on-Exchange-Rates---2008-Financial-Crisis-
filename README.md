# Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates---2008-Financial-Crisis-
The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union. Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set and made it available on Kaggle 
— the data source is the European Central Bank.
